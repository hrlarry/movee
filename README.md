movee
=====

Movee is a very primitive front-end prototype of an app intended to help involve family members in promoting elderly relatives' health by providing elderly individuals an engaging virtual environment for a more rewarding exercise experience. Family members can contribute to the experience by uploading packages (e.g. vacation photos, grandchildrens' recital footage, etc.) to unlock after achieving certain health milestones.
